# BilzJoin+

# What is BilzJoin+
Modern cosmetics plugin (JoinMessages, JoinSounds, JoinEffects, JoinPlus)

# Does it have dependencies?
No dependencies as such, but if you want to use PlaceholderAPI variables you need to have it installed.

# What are the differences with the free one?
Too many differences, the free one has limits and in "BilzJoin+" you set the limits, you have free creation of all cosmetics except "JoinEffects" for reasons that handle other parameters.
